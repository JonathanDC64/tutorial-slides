# Installing Arduino IDE and Teensyduino

* Download and install the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your operating system. The current latest version is 1.0.5.

  * The Arduino IDE is written in Java. You may need to install the [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) if it is not already installed on your workstation.

  * Installation instructions are found [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)

* Teensy is an Arduino Compatible development board. Since it is not manufactured by Arduino, some middleware is necessary for loading code onto the device.

* Download and install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) for your operating system.

* Verify that your development environment works by following the instructions on the [Teensy website](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html) for loading and running the "Blink" program.
